# plutotv-schedule
An API to extract Pluto.tv show schedule data.

I need this API because I am creating a TV Tracker web app that will display a hybrid schedule/imdb/news kind of information.  I am starting with Pluto.tv since I watch it, and it seems to be on the cutting edge of the future of "television/streaming."

The TV Tracker will display a TV schedule in a table, showing the normal times, date, etc for the show/movie.  If you click on the row, it will expand and show the actors in the tv-show/movie, pulled from imdb.com, and then also news for the actors pulled from newsapi.org, and possibly also from wikipedia.

This app will eliminate the need to go to multiple websites to get interesting information about the actors and/or the TV show/movie.
